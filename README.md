## Overview

[Luck.io](https://luck.io/) is a fully non-custodial online casino powered by the Solana blockchain. It provides a secure, decentralized gaming experience where users retain full control of their funds—no KYC verification required. Built for speed, transparency, and fun, Luck.io leverages Solana's high-performance network to deliver instant transactions and provably fair gameplay.

Whether you're a crypto enthusiast or just looking for thrilling casino games, Luck.io offers a seamless, trustless environment to play without intermediaries.

## Key Features

- **Fully Non-Custodial**: Your wallet, your keys—Luck.io never holds your funds. Connect your Solana wallet (e.g., Phantom, Solflare) and play directly.
- **No KYC Required**: Privacy-first design; start playing anonymously without sharing personal information.
- **Solana-Powered**: Lightning-fast transactions with low fees, thanks to Solana's high-throughput blockchain.
- **Provably Fair Games**: All outcomes are verifiable on-chain, ensuring transparency and fairness.
- **Offline Mode Support**: Switch to offline mode for testing or demo purposes without connecting to the blockchain.
- **JavaScript-Enabled App**: Modern web interface requiring JavaScript for full functionality.

## How It Works

1. **Connect Your Wallet**: Visit [luck.io](https://luck.io/) and connect your Solana-compatible wallet. The app will prompt "Attempting to connect..."—approve the connection in your wallet.
2. **Deposit & Play**: Transfer SOL or supported tokens to your wallet and dive into casino games like slots, blackjack, roulette, and more.
3. **Withdraw Anytime**: Cash out winnings directly to your wallet with instant Solana settlements.
4. **Verify Fairness**: Each game round is logged on-chain; use Solana explorers to audit results.

For development or local testing, enable offline mode via the provided link to simulate gameplay without live blockchain interactions.
